# journal
Journal is a lightweight private blogging service designed to share.

Journal is super fast because all client side JS is optional, and all rendering is done server side.

Journal has a feature called 'widgets' that allow posts to contain small javascript interactives and graphics.

Journal uses:
* Typescript
* Koa
* normalize.css
* koa-bodyparser
* koa-ratelimit
* koa-router
* koa-session
* koa-static
* koa-views
* ejs (Apache License 2.0, http://www.apache.org/licenses/) 
* marked
